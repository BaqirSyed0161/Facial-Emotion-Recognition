# Facial-Emotion-Recognition

Facial-Recognition using HOG and SVM with JAFFE and CK datasets
- The project uses traditional machine learning techniques to classify facial expressions from images.

Method used:
- Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for feature extraction  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification  

Datasets used:
- JAFFE dataset  
- CK (Cohn–Kanade) dataset  

Notes
- No deep learning or neural networks are used.
